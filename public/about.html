  <h1>about me </h1>
  <p>A highly motivated and disciplined 18-year-old from Egypt,
    <br> I have dedicated the past year to independently honing my cybersecurity skills.
    <br> Through hands-on experience in bug bounty hunting,
    <br> I've cultivated a keen analytical mind and a passion for problem-solving.
    <br> As a big dreamer with a leadership inclination,
    <br> I am driven to make a significant impact in the cybersecurity field.</p>
